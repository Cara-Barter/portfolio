        I am an Indigenous woman who has a deep passion for the health of Mother
        Earth and helping others. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Indigenous
        Studies and Environmental Studies from the University of Victoria. I am
        a Fibre Artist turned Web Dev Weaver. I love solving puzzles to make
        products more usable. I employ my gifts of empathy and creativivty to
        reduce pain points for users and customers. I strive to really listen
        and understand people to understand their perspective and know what they
        are looking for.
